# Project: GitHub Actions CI/CD for Playwright Tests

This project focuses on implementing continuous integration and deployment workflows for automated testing using GitHub Actions. Part of my [#100DaysOfAutomationLearning](https://github.com/yourusername/100DaysOfAutomationLearning) journey.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

**Objective**: Set up automated test execution using GitHub Actions to run Playwright tests on every push/pull request, establishing a robust CI/CD pipeline for quality assurance.

**Tech Stack**: GitHub Actions, Playwright, YAML configuration, Environment variable management

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Discovery

### Game-Changing Command
```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

**Key Learning**: This command automatically generates the GitHub Actions YAML file, making the CI/CD setup process incredibly streamlined. Minimal manual configuration required beyond adjusting workflow paths to match project structure.

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Challenges & Solutions

### Environment Variables in CI/CD
**Challenge**: Managing `.env` files that are required for Playwright tests but are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

**Solution**: Utilized GitHub Secrets to securely store environment variables and configure them in the workflow YAML:

```yaml
env:
  SERVICENOW_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.SERVICENOW_USERNAME }}
  SERVICENOW_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SERVICENOW_PASSWORD }}
  SERVICENOW_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SERVICENOW_BASE_URL }}
```

### Project Structure Adaptation
**Configuration needed**: Updated workflow paths to accommodate custom project directory structure rather than default Playwright layout.

## ðŸ¤– AI-Assisted Development Experience

### ChatGPT-5 Performance Assessment
**Honest reflection**: Rather than diving deep into GitHub Actions documentation, I leveraged ChatGPT-5 for rapid implementation and learning.

**Results**:
- **Speed**: Working GitHub Actions workflow in approximately 1 hour
- **Accuracy**: Zero incorrect YAML configurations or `playwright.config.ts` suggestions
- **Reliability**: Significantly improved experience compared to previous AI models and providers

**Previous Experience vs. Current**:
- **Past projects**: Trial-and-error approach with other AI models until something worked
- **ChatGPT-5 experience**: Felt like working with a reliable, knowledgeable team member
- **Confidence level**: High trust in generated configurations and recommendations

## ðŸ“ˆ Skills Developed

- **GitHub Actions workflow configuration**
- **CI/CD pipeline setup for test automation**
- **Environment variable management in cloud environments**
- **YAML syntax and GitHub Actions-specific configurations**
- **Integration of Playwright with cloud-based CI/CD**

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

1. **Automation tooling has evolved significantly** - Modern setup commands eliminate much of the manual configuration overhead

2. **AI-assisted development quality varies dramatically** - ChatGPT-5 demonstrated notably higher accuracy and reliability for DevOps tasks

3. **Documentation vs. AI-guided learning** - While traditional documentation study has its place, AI-guided rapid prototyping can accelerate practical learning when balanced appropriately

4. **Environment security** - Proper secrets management is crucial for CI/CD pipelines handling sensitive credentials

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Features Implemented

- Automated test execution on push/pull requests
- Multi-environment variable configuration
- Artifact collection for test results
- Failure notifications and reporting

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Value for Consulting

This CI/CD setup demonstrates enterprise-level automation practices that consulting clients expect:
- Automated quality gates
- Secure credential management
- Scalable test execution
- Integration with modern development workflows
